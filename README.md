My [ClojuTRE][clojutre] 2018 talk: "Optimizing My Mental Focus with
Machine Learning and Clojure"

## How to use

Ugh, even though my talk is done and the code is now properly
documented, I ran out of time and didn't manage to write the readme!
So in the meantime, please refer to the `clojutre_talk.clj` file for
now and feel free to message me repeatedly if things are unclear :)

I'll do my best to create a small tutorial with some sample data in
the next week.
